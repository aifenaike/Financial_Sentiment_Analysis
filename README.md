# Financial_Sentiment_Analysis
Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment strength from a textual source for good decision making. This work focuses on application of sentiment analysis in the financial space.

## Review Dataset
The dataset consists of financial news. These sentiments are represented on a 3 point scale (positive, neutral or negative). Here are three examples from the dataset:

Review 1 – Label -1 (**Negative sentiment**)

**In a separate announcement to the Helsinki stock exchange , Atria revealed that the company 's third quarter profits declined from EUR13 .9 m in the third quarter of last year to EUR12 .7 m in this year 's Q3 .**

Review 2 – Label 0 (**Neutral sentiment**)

**The company will issue an inaugural Eurobond deal in the near future subject to market conditions .**

Review 3 – Label 1 (**Positive sentiment**)

**ARM Royalties Accelerate as Smartphone Market Regains Strength**

In this project, I compared different models for sentiment analysis on financial texts.
