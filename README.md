# Financial_Sentiment_Analysis
Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment strength from a textual source for good decision making. This work focuses on application of sentiment analysis in financial news.


In this project, I compared different models for sentiment analysis on financial texts.
## MODEL ARCHITECTURES
- Rule based approach using Lexicon
- Traditional Machine Learning approach using Tfidf
- LSTM as a Recurrent Neural Network architecture
- BERT (and ALBERT)
